# .NET 10 and Quartz.Net 4.1.0 Upgrade - Summary

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the xtreamium-proxy project from .NET 9 to .NET 10 and Quartz.Net 3.x to 4.1.0.

## Changes Made

### 1. RecordJob.cs (Services/Jobs/)
**Issue**: The `IJob.Execute` method signature changed in Quartz 4.1.0
- ✅ Added `CancellationToken cancellationToken` parameter to the method signature
- ✅ Changed return type from `Task` to `ValueTask`
- ✅ Updated to use the parameter-passed cancellation token instead of `context.CancellationToken`

**Before:**
```csharp
public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context) { ... }
```

**After:**
```csharp
public async ValueTask Execute(IJobExecutionContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { ... }
```

### 2. RecordingsEndpoint.cs (Endpoints/)
**Issue**: The `ScheduleJob` method signature changed in Quartz 4.1.0
- ✅ Removed `CancellationToken` parameter from two `ScheduleJob` calls (lines 76 and 171)

**Before:**
```csharp
await scheduler.ScheduleJob(job, trigger, ct);
```

**After:**
```csharp
await scheduler.ScheduleJob(job, trigger);
```

### 3. JobsStartup.cs (Services/Jobs/)
**Issue**: Multiple Quartz API changes in configuration
- ✅ Removed `q.SchedulerId` property (doesn't exist in 4.1.0)
- ✅ Removed `q.SchedulerName` assignment (read-only in 4.1.0)
- ✅ Fixed SQLite connection string - removed unsupported `Version=3;` parameter
- ✅ Added `options.ProvisionSchema()` to handle database initialization
- ✅ Added `options.UseSystemTextJsonSerializer()` for consistency

**Before:**
```csharp
q.SchedulerId = "Xtreamium-Proxy-Scheduler";
q.SchedulerName = "Xtreamium Proxy Scheduler";
options.UseMicrosoftSQLite(jobsDb);
```

**After:**
```csharp
options.UseSystemTextJsonSerializer();
options.UseSqlite($"Data Source={jobsDb}");
options.ProvisionSchema();
```

### 4. RecordingService.cs (Services/)
**Issue**: Removed obsolete `GetCurrentlyExecutingJobs` method that doesn't exist in Quartz 4.1.0
- ✅ Removed the job execution check (not available in 4.1.0)
- ✅ Simplified job deletion to always wait 2 seconds for graceful cancellation

**Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESS** (4 warnings - pre-existing nullable reference warnings)

## Required Actions After Deployment

### Database Migration
When you first run the upgraded application, it will encounter a Quartz schema incompatibility if you're migrating from Quartz 3.x. To resolve:

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
The application will automatically detect the issue and attempt to reinitialize. However, if you have an existing database:

**Option 2: Manual**
Run the provided migration script:
```bash
bash /tmp/fix_quartz_db.sh
```

Or manually delete the database files:
```bash
rm ~/.xtreamium-proxy/config_dev.db
rm ~/.xtreamium-proxy/config.db
```

The database files will be automatically recreated with the correct schema on the next startup.

⚠️ **Note**: This only affects the Quartz scheduler tables. Your recording data (stored elsewhere) will NOT be affected.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Build Verification**: ✅ Project builds successfully
2. **Schema Creation**: Verify database tables are created correctly on first run
3. **Job Scheduling**: Test that recordings can be scheduled and executed
4. **Job Deletion**: Test that running jobs can be cancelled and deleted
5. **Logs**: Check application logs for any Quartz configuration warnings

## Version Information
- **Target Framework**: net10.0
- **Quartz.Net**: 4.1.0
- **.NET SDK**: 10.0.201
- **Key Changes**: 
  - `IJob.Execute` now uses `ValueTask` instead of `Task`
  - New `CancellationToken` parameter in job execute methods
  - SQLite connection string validation (no Version parameter)
  - Schema provisioning now handles by `options.ProvisionSchema()`

## Compatibility Notes
- All Quartz.Net 4.1.0 extension methods are properly configured
- System.Text.Json serialization enabled for job data
- Persistence store properly configured for SQLite
- Hosted service configured to wait for jobs to complete on shutdown
